Humano: yeah Alright. Let’s do that I like this subject line nobody ever says Wow! You carry a lot of tension in your abs! or Why don’t dogs need massages?” Martine says there’s something suspiciously Neolithic about massage therapy. Why do I live and dies by when my last deep tissue massage was. I minimize sitting and get a good sleep on a firm mattress. Maybe I have farther to go than I think
reducing some stress in general. And why is it everyone’s back? Maybe structured repetitive work outs are to blame. More playing and helping load, moving vans. I always thought piano movers have the most primal occupations
