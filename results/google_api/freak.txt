Humano: even though the book is published on the Department of Defense website – actually, it’s not really “published,” it’s just sitting there as a Microsoft Word document for anybody to read – but anyway, the screw-ups that it chronicles are not limited to the Department of Defense. The stories come from all over the Federal government. You’ve got the I.R.S. represented, Veterans’ Affairs, government safety inspectors. Here, here’s one entry. The headline is: But Judge, I Didn’t Get Anything! An offshore safety inspector found much of the Government’s equipment to be in need of repairs to meet safety standards. He then referred the business to his brother-in-law’s repair shop.
